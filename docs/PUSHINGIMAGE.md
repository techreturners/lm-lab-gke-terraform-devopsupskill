## Instructions

The next phase for getting your custom Docker images deployed is to push them to your very own private container registry.

By now you will have provisioned a container registry on Google Cloud so now we have somewhere to push our Docker images.

### Step 1 - Ensure you have an image to push

Firstly we'll need to make sure we have a docker image of our application ready to push.

Let's push up an image of the Python app we worked with in session 3.

Navigate to the directory for that application (that you cloned in session 3).

It's on the link below if you need to re-clone

### Step 2 - Build the docker image

Make sure Docker is running on your computer and build the docker image by running this command:

```
docker build -t devops-bookstore-api:1.0 .
```

That will produce a local docker image. One that we can PUSH up to your container registry.

### Step 3 - Authenticating docker to allow the push

Next we need to make sure your local docker instance has the right credentials to push up to your container registry. 

Follow through the two steps on the GCP documentation using the [gcloud credential helper instructions](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud-helper) 

### Step 4 - Tag your docker image with the location of your registry

The way you tell Docker about your container registries is through the tagging system.

You can tag the image you built in step 2 with a new tag for your container registry. To do this (replace the PROJECT-ID with your GCP project ID):

```
docker tag devops-bookstore-api:1.0 eu.gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/devops-bookstore-api:1.0
```

You can see your Docker images by running `docker images` and you should see your tagged version.

### Step 5 - Push your image

Once the image has been tagged and you have configured docker to be authenticated with your account you should be able to push your image.

```
docker push eu.gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/devops-bookstore-api:1.0
```

If all works you should see it show progress of your "push"

### Step 6 - Check the image through your GCP console

If you then open up the GCP web console you should be able to navigate to the container registry and see your image. It should look similar to the image below:

![GCR Example Image](./images/gcr_example.png)

You can now head back to the [README](../README.md) and lets work through getting that image deployed.
